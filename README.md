# AZAN_CLOCK
This is a console based program which we built using C-language.
The application consists of 3 main features:
1. CLOCK
2. AZAN TIMINGS
3. DUAS

**CLOCK**
In this feature you will get to see the current default time of your device. You can get the time in both 12 nad 24 hours format.

**AZAN TIMINGS**
In this feature you will get to see the timings of the azan of daily prayers. You can set the time of the prayers according to your azan time by going into **edit azan**. And when the time hits the azan timings it will be playing the azan as well display the name of the azan.

**DUAS**
In this feature you will get to see some basic important duas. By selecting the specific dua you can hear the audio of the dua along with its transliteration as well as translation of it in english.

This are the main features of our application. To better understand this application, I'll suggest watching the video representation that I attached with the files.
